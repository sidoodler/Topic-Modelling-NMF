9506,"prior to a new hotel opening on amity island a great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing the wreckage of the orca a couple of days later their camera is recovered and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver killing the skier while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun causing the boat to explode killing her and burning the sharks head
along with these disappearances a killer whale carcass is found beached police chief martin brody believes that these events are a sharks responsibility brody explains his concerns to mayor larry vaughn who highly doubts that the town is under another shark crisis later brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach he wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat drivers burnt remains that evening brody calls matt hooper for assistance but he is unable to return to amity due to a research expedition he is currently part of thus brody is on his own
the following day at the beach brody sees a dark shadow that approaches the swimmers thinking that it is a shark he frantically orders everyone out of the water and fires from his gun however the shadow is revealed to be a rather harmless school of bluefish his fears are confirmed when he acquires a closeup picture of the shark from the divers camera the amity town council including local developer len peterson deny the evidence and vote brody out as police chief
the next morning brodys teenage son mike disobeys his fathers orders by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends after his love interest jackie peters goads him to but his younger brother sean catches him and persuades mike to bring him along after an argument at the dock marge one of mikes friends playfully lets sean come in her boat with her and after a couple of other grouping arrangements they head out going past a team of divers led by instructor tom andrews moments after submerging andrews encounters the shark panicking he rushes to the surface causing an embolism soon after the shark hits teenagers tina wilcox and eddie marchand eddie falls into the water and is killed by the shark
brody and his wife ellen follow an ambulance to the docks where they find tom as he is put on a stretcher the divers suspect something scared him underwater deputy len hendricks brodys replacement tells them that mike went sailing with his friends so brody along with ellen and hendricks takes the police boat to rescue them they find tina hiding in the bow of her boat and she informs them of the sharks presence hendricks and ellen take tina to shore where the truth is revealed while brody goes on to find the kids
meanwhile the shark attacks the other kids striking one of their boats causing most of them to capsize and crash into each other in the ensuing chaos throwing several of them including mike and sean into the water the other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats a coast guard marine helicopter that brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore but the shark sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls it then knocks sean into the water but marge saves him only for herself to be killed while doing so

5465,"people will talk describes an episode in the life of dr noah praetorius a physician who teaches in a medical school and founded a clinic dedicated to treating patients humanely and holistically the plot contains two parallel story lines a professionalmisconduct challenge brought against praetorius by his more conventional colleague dr rodney elwell who dislikes praetoriuss unorthodox but effective methods and the struggle of a distressed young woman named deborah higgins who falls in love with praetorius while dealing with an outofwedlock pregnancy the film also highlights praetoriuss close friend and confidant physics professor lyonel barker who plays bass viol in the studentfaculty orchestra conducted by praetorius

elwells detective discovers that shunderson was once convicted of murder and elwell calls for a misconduct hearing against praetorius at the hearing praetorius explains that he started his career in a small town by opening a butcher shop as a front for his undeclared medical practice because the people of the town didnt trust doctors elwell accuses praetorius of quackery but praetorius defends himself with the fact that he was a licensed practitioner describing how he was forced to leave town after his maid discovered his medical degree
praetorius refuses to answer questions about shunderson but shunderson explains that he served  years in prison for the alleged death of a man who had tried to murder him then somehow survived being hanged after actually murdering the man who had gone into hiding during the first trial when he woke up he was lying on a table in front of praetorius who was at that time a medical student examining what he believed was a cadaver praetorius kept shundersons survival a secret and shunderson became praetoriuss devoted friend after this story is told the chairman concludes the hearing in praetoriuss favor and elwell walks away alone and discredited
meanwhile deborah enters praetoriuss life displaying signs of emotional distress after she faints during a lecture praetorius examines her and informs her that shes pregnant upset by this news mrs higgins admits that shes not really married the unborn childs father is dead and knowing about her condition would be too much for her own father to bear in a hallway near praetoriuss office she shoots herself
after successfully operating on deborah praetorius tries to calm her by telling her there was a mistake in her pregnancy test but she has fallen in love with him and becomes upset at her own embarrassing behavior she runs away from the clinic forcing him to find her so he can tell her she really is pregnant
praetorius and shunderson drive out to where deborah and her father arthur live a farm owned by arthurs brother john deborah and praetorius hide deborahs shooting incident from her father who is a failure in life and lives unhappily as a dependent of his stingy brother deborah is his only pride in life which might become intolerable for him with a baby to take care of and his daughters reputation ruined
